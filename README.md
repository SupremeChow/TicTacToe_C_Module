# TicTacToe_C_Module
I hate C. This is a C module of the game Tic-Tac-Toe made for a class project for Linux operating systems. I hate working in operating systems and C. Code should work and be correct, but it being in C and the class being a wreck and during Covid, I will always assume the worst. The code was privately uploaded from another account for school. I hate C.
